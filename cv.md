## About me
> I study at BSU at the Faculty of Radiophysics and Computer Technologies. My **goal** is to **complete the RS2021Q1** course without dropping out of university.
> I love challenging tasks, especially when I see the result. I want to challenge myself, get out of my comfort zone, and gain experience and a lot of knowledge.
